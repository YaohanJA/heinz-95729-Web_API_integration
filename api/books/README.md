# Book.js Source
The Book module demonstrates subtype polymorphism in JavaScript. Using `Object.assign`, or the spread operator, we can extend the schema of `Product`

```JavaScript
const Book = immutable('book', {
  // Inherit/Extend Product
  ...Product.blueprint,
  ...{
    metadata: {
      // Inherit Product.metadata
      ...Product.blueprint.metadata,
      // extend Product.metadata with a required array of authors
      ...{
        authors: 'Author[]'
      }
    }
  }
})
```
